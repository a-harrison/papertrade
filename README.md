### PaperTrade

This is a personal learning project created using FastAPI.

Final vision is a web app that allows for tracking stock trading with friends.
A user can invite friends, create contests of a certain dollar amount (not real
money) with a time length, and a dashboard to allow users to see how well they
perform against one another.

This repository is the server side API. Final vision would be a front-end made in
React or other framework.
